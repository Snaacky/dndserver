## What sort of contributions are you looking for?
### Software engineers

We are looking for contributors who are fluent in Python and have an understanding of data structures, packet analysis, and protobufs for furthering development. 

### Reverse engineers

We are looking for contributors who are fluent in C/asm (x64) with reverse engineering experience (hooking, detours, injection, IDA/Ghidra/x64dbg, etc.) who can help with creating patches for bugs and helping us further understand how the server interacts with the client and vice-versa.

### Wireshark dumps

If you have Wireshark dumps from any of the playtests, we would love to hear from you! This is an easy way for less technically skilled users to still help contribute to developement.
